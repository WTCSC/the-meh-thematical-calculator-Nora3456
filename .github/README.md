# The Meh-thematical Calulator!

This code runs a calculator. Although, there's an interesting feature to the calculator... For one, the calculator is unenthusiastic about it's job. It prefers to not work, socialize, or really do anything, but still has to show up when needed. The calculator **WILL** take its anger towards working out on you, don't take it too personally.

##  How to run the calculator after opening the program:

1. 👋 | The calculator will give you a welcome message, then ask you for your first number. **Have your equation you want answered decided before you answer the calculators first question.** 🔢 | To answer the first question type in whatever number is the start of your equation, then press enter, **only type the first number!**. 
2. 🖩 | After doing step 1, the calculator will ask you what you want to do (in terms of adding(+), subtracting(-), multplying(*), or dividing(/)). **Only type in the symbol that represents what you would like to do**, after typing your answer, press enter.
3. 🔢 | After doing step 2, the calculator will ask you one final question. That question is asking for your second number. Type in **only** your second number, no extra symbols/letters etc, then press enter.
4. 😒 | Your equation and answer will be shown!... Along with an unenthusiastic message from the calculator...
5. 🔁 | **This step only matters if you would like to run the calculator again**. Unfortunately, the calculator won't reset on it's own, its a lazy worker. To re-run the calculator, press the play icon (▶️) and the terminal will reset. Then follow steps 1-4 again!

1. ➕ | The of these sections is for addition, using 2 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 2 positive decimal numbers.
2. ➖ | The second section is for subtraction, using 2 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 2 positive decimal numbers.
3. ✖️ | The third section is for multiplication, using 2 positive numbers, one positive and one negative number, 2 negative numbers, and 2 positive decimal numbers. 
4. ➗ | The fourth and final section is for division, using 2 positive numbers, one positive and one negative number, 2 negative numbers, and 2 positive decimal numbers. As well, the divison section tests for 1 positive number, followed by 0."
